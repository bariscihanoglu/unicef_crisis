Improving relations, however, remained fragile; Nigerien President Gen. Tiani 25 Dec accused Benin of having, in concert with France, delivered drones to armed groups operating in border areas."
Pakistan,December 2024,"Surging militant attacks in provinces bordering Afghanistan prompted military to launch cross-border airstrikes, triggering exchange of fire with Taliban; former PM Imran Khan sought negotiations with govt.","Militant attacks and counter-insurgency operations persisted at high intensity. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, three security operations 6-7 Dec killed six soldiers, as military claimed killing 22 militants.

Türkiye,December 2024,Ankara welcomed fall of Assad regime in Syria as Türkiye-backed forces pressed against Kurdish-led forces in Syria’s north east; military continued targeting Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.,"Fall of Assad regime in Syria marked turning point for Ankara. Following dramatic collapse of House of Assad in Syria on 8 Dec (see Syria and Conflict in Focus), Ankara found its strategic position much improved: fall of Assad marked blow to Türkiye’s regional competitors Russia and Iran, reduced threat of refugee flows and boosted prospect of returning millions of Syrian refugees in Türkiye, and provided Ankara with potential to wield greater influence given its relations with Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and armed groups that participated in offensive to topple Assad. Meanwhile, Ankara-backed local forces in Syria expelled U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces – led by PKK-affiliated People’s Protection Units (YPG) – from areas in north, raising prospect of further clashes (though U.S. brokerage halted advances as of 31 Dec). FM Hakan Fidan 13 Dec warned “YPG either dissolves itself or will be dissolved”. Military continued operations against PKK. In northern Iraq, military 1 Dec announced it “neutralised” nine militants, 13 Dec two militants, 20 Dec 11 militants and 28 Dec two militants. Meanwhile, at home, govt continued crackdown against pro-Kurdish political party (DEM) and its municipalities even as discussions around new political process to end 40-year conflict with PKK advanced; govt 31 Dec allowed delegation from DEM party to visit imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan. Authorities conducted operations against Islamic State (ISIS) countrywide. Security forces during Dec detained some 680 alleged ISIS members. Notably, Ministry of Interior 31 Dec announced authorities had detained 536 suspects across 57 provinces in operations 19-31 Dec. Ankara continued engagement with Greece. Greek Deputy FM Alexandra Papadopoulou and Turkish Deputy FM Mehmet Kemal Bozay 3 Dec met in Greek capital Athens, announcing that 6th High Level Cooperation Council is set to take place in capital Ankara in early 2025. In address to parliament, FM Hakan Fidan 11 Dec reaffirmed govt’s commitment to “positive agenda” with Greece; Greece and Republic of Cyprus are concerned about prospect of Türkiye and new Syrian govt striking maritime delimitation deal."
Iran,December 2024,"UN nuclear watchdog reported “very worrisome” increase in Iran’s uranium enrichment, while collapse of Syria’s Assad regime dealt another blow to Iran’s regional “forward defence” doctrine.","Tehran upped enrichment, accepted increased safeguards amid threat of snapback sanctions. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi 6 Dec confirmed Iranian capacity to enrich uranium up to 60% purity was increasing potentially to at least “seven, eight times more” than current level. In response, E3 (UK, France and Germany) 9 Dec called for halt of “nuclear escalation”. Iran 12 Dec agreed to increase IAEA safeguard measures at Fordow enrichment facility. E3 17 Dec noted UN Security Council resolution 2231 that endorsed 2015 nuclear deal would expire Oct 2025 – closing window for potentially triggering “snapback” mechanism to restore pre-2015 UN sanctions – and called next ten months “pivotal” for solving “Iran nuclear crisis”; UK Ambassador to UN 17 Dec reiterated E3 would trigger snapback “if necessary” to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapon. Toppling of Syrian President Assad capped winter of discontent for Iran. FM Araghchi 2 Dec visited Syrian capital Damascus to vow continued support for Assad after rebel group Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) late Nov led flash offensive, but Tehran 6 Dec evacuated military and diplomatic personnel (see Syria and Conflict in Focus). After Assad regime 8 Dec collapsed, leader of HTS Ahmed al-Sharaa same day bemoaned Syria had become “playground for Iranian ambitions”; fall of House of Assad marks major strategic setback and comes shortly after Israel significantly weakened Hizbollah in Lebanon and degraded Iran’s own defences with airstrikes. Supreme Leader Khamenei 11 Dec claimed Assad regime’s collapse “planned in the command rooms of the U.S. and Israel”. New Syrian leadership 29 Dec indicated future relations with Tehran would have to “be based on respect for the sovereignty of both countries and non-interference”. U.S./EU imposed more sanctions on Iran-linked targets . EU 16 Dec included one Iran-based company in sanctions package targeting those “supporting Russia’s military and industrial complex”. Washington 18-19 Dec blacklisted more than 30 individuals, entities and vessels tied to Iran’s missile and drone programs, petroleum trade, human rights abuses and support for Houthis."
Israel/Palestine,December 2024,"Humanitarian crisis spiralled in Gaza as Israel escalated siege in north amid onset of winter, while ceasefire talks again hit impasse; Trump administration in Jan could embolden Israel in Gaza, West Bank and against nemesis Iran.","Israel continued siege and depopulation campaign in northern Gaza. Israeli forces killed over 1,100 Palestinians across Gaza Strip in Dec, bringing official death toll since 7 Oct 2023 to at least 45,500 as of 31 Dec. Israel continued airstrikes and ground operations across strip and maintained siege, starvation and indiscriminate violence in northern Gaza, which aggravated dire humanitarian crisis and forced population displacement southward. UNRWA 1-10 Dec paused aid delivery through Kerem Shalom crossing, citing Israel’s failure to prevent looting. Israeli attacks escalated on and around Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia city in north, killing five medical staff and forcing medical workers and patients out. UN experts 30 Dec slammed Israel for “inflicting maximum suffering on civilians”. Qatari-mediated ceasefire talks reportedly restarted and made progress; Hamas appeared to compromise on demand for full Israeli withdrawal but PM Netanyahu asserted Israel will not end war and made new demand, insisting on list of all hostages ahead of deal. In West Bank, Palestinian Authority (PA) targeted armed groups, Israeli settler violence persisted. PA 5 Dec besieged Jenin refugee camp and 14 Dec launched operations against Jenin Brigades, killing at least eight, including four civilians, which stoked public anger. Meanwhile, Israeli raids, airstrikes and settler attacks continued, killing dozens throughout Dec. Settler leaders 15 Dec pressed Israeli cabinet to apply “northern Gaza model” to West Bank to expel large parts of Palestinian population; with new U.S. administration in Jan set to embrace Israel’s far-right ambitions, Israel could pursue de jure annexation of parts of West Bank and forcibly transfer thousands of Palestinians. Israel remained engaged in regional hostilities. Houthis intensified strikes on Israel, which launched waves of airstrikes (see Yemen); ceasefire with Hizbollah largely held despite violations (see Lebanon); following collapse of Assad regime in Syria, Israel occupied positions in and beyond UN buffer zone and decimated military infrastructure (see Syria and Conflict in Focus). Incoming Trump administration could embolden Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear sites (see Iran)."
Benin,November 2024,"Opposition formed coalition for 2026 general elections, authorities repressed OB26 political movement, and jihadist violence persisted.","Opposition parties formed coalition, high-profile political arrests continued. Four opposition parties 10 Nov formed coalition under leadership of Thomas Boni Yayi, former president and leader of Les Démocrates, largest opposition party in National Assembly; doubts, however, remained over capacity of coalition, which aims to unseat President Talon and repair “damaged democracy”. Adding to increasingly tense political climate, security forces 13 Nov arrested Philippe Houndégnon, former police chief and close associate of Boni Yayi, charged him with “inciting rebellion and electronic harassment”. Pressure on OB26 movement remained high. Jean Eudes Mitokpe, president of OB26 – which backs businessman Olivier Boko who was detained in Sept on suspicion of plotting coup – said he received threats, prompting him 9 Nov to postpone OB26 public meeting. Court 28 Nov requested two-year prison sentence for Hosée Houngnibo, coordinator of OB26 and of Boko’s social media, who was previously arrested in Oct for inciting rebellion, verdict expected Jan 2025.

Pakistan,November 2024,"Tens of thousands rallied in capital Islamabad to support former PM Imran Khan, triggering violent crackdown; militant attacks and sectarian clashes killed dozens in Afghan border provinces.","Govt clamped down on major protest by Khan supporters. Imprisoned leader of opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan 13 Nov issued “final call” for protests in Islamabad on 24 Nov against PTI’s “stolen mandate”, “unjust arrests”, and govt’s 26th constitutional amendment, which expanded parliament’s and executive’s powers to make judicial appointments. Undeterred by threat of arrests, PTI supporters 25 Nov reached capital, where police fired tear gas and used baton charges, arresting almost 1,000; protesters sought to enter area housing National Assembly and PM’s office. Govt 26 Nov called in army, reportedly authorising it to shoot “PTI miscreants” on sight; paramilitary rangers and police undertook late-night crackdown, forcing protestors to flee capital. Clashes killed four security personnel and at least two civilians, injured scores; PTI claimed 12 supporters were killed and hundreds suffered gunshot wounds. Govt filed charges against Khan, his wife and hundreds more, including for “terrorism”. PTI late Nov called off protest but turmoil could worsen if govt enacts reported threats to ban PTI or impose federal rule on PTI-governed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (see Conflict in Focus). Militant and sectarian violence killed dozens. In Balochistan province, Balochistan Liberation Army suicide bomber 9 Nov targeted troops at capital Quetta’s railway station, killing 26 (including more than dozen soldiers) and injuring more than 60.

Türkiye,November 2024,"Military continued pressure on Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Iraq and Syria, while govt closely watched rebel offensive in northern Syria and pursued engagement with Baghdad and Greece.","Govt continued operations against PKK, while mulling new political process. Military continued strikes on PKK in Iraq and Syria after deadly PKK attack in Ankara in Oct that killed five and injured 22. Notably, military 22 Nov announced it neutralised nine PKK members in northern Iraq and northern Syria, including senior member. Meanwhile, speculation continued around details of possible new process between govt and PKK after President Erdoğan and his nationalist ally Devlet Bahçeli in Oct signalled willingness. Govt pressure on pro-Kurdish DEM party continued; notably, Ministry of Interior during Nov appointed trustees to five municipalities to replace elected DEM officials. Authorities continued crackdown on Islamic State (ISIS). Authorities during Nov detained some 77 individuals with suspected links to ISIS. Notably, police 6 Nov arrested three individuals for providing financial support to group in multi-province operation. Ankara monitored rebel advance in Syria’s north west. As rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied Turkish-backed factions 27 Nov launched major offensive against govt forces in Syria’s north west, FM Hakan Fidan 30 Nov remarked “Türkiye is not involved in the clashes” and “We will not engage in any action that might trigger a new wave of migration”; govt and Russia prepared counteroffensive and intensified airstrikes/shelling, which risks displacing hundreds of thousands of Syrians toward Turkish border (see Syria). Govt engaged Iraq and held high-level meeting in Greece. In second visit to Türkiye since 2022, Iraqi PM Mohammed Sudani 1 Nov met Erdoğan in Ankara, where pair reportedly discussed bilateral cooperation initiatives, including Development Road project. Meanwhile, Fidan and Greek FM Giorgos Gerapetritis 8 Nov met in Greece’s capital Athens and highlighted shared commitment to “positive agenda”, with Fidan advocating “win-win” approach to enhance security and prosperity for both nations; FMs also reportedly discussed how to build confidence and inch toward talks on delimitation of continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zones in Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, with further meetings scheduled for Dec."
Iran,November 2024,"Tehran threatened military response against Israel, raising risk of another cycle of destructive escalation; after censure at UN nuclear watchdog, Iran responded by activating “advanced” centrifuges.","Tehran reiterated vow to respond to Israeli strikes, welcomed Lebanon truce. After Israel 26 Oct struck military sites in Iran, region awaited Tehran’s response. Notably, senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 1 Nov warned of potential change in nuclear doctrine “if the survival of Iran comes under serious threat”. Israeli/U.S. intelligence during early Nov noted weapons movements from Iran to Iraq, potentially indicating Tehran’s reprisal could be conducted by or in coordination with Iran-backed militias (see Iraq). Iranian military commander 26 Nov said response had been “devised beyond what [Israeli] leaders can imagine”. Tehran 27 Nov welcomed ceasefire in Lebanon, while reiterating “right to react” to “Israeli aggression” (see Lebanon). Iran expanded enrichment capacity after watchdog censure. Rafael Grossi, head of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 13 Nov arrived in capital Tehran to make “substantive progress” on nuclear transparency and safeguards. But citing lack of progress, Board 21 Nov passed censuring resolution against Iran with E3 (UK, France and Germany) alleging Iran’s “nuclear escalation” constituted “threat to international security” and requesting “comprehensive” IAEA report by spring 2025; resolution passed with 19 votes in favour, and China, Russia and Burkina Faso voting against. In response, Tehran 23 Nov announced activation of “advanced” centrifuges; media citing IAEA report 28 Nov revealed Iran informed agency of intention to add 6,000 centrifuges at Natanz and Fordow enrichment facilities. In potential offramp, Tehran 29 Nov held talks with deputy FMs of E3 to discuss regional situation and nuclear file. Further underscoring risks, senior Iranian diplomat 21 Nov threatened to withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if “snapback sanctions” built into 2015 nuclear deal were triggered next year. Iran raised trial balloons ahead of Trump presidency. Amid fears second Trump administration beginning Jan 2025 may revamp “maximum pressure” approach of sanctions and isolation, FM Seyed Abbas Araghchi 9 Nov called for mutual respect with U.S., asserting “Maximum Wisdom” would be better than U.S. coercion."
Israel/Palestine,November 2024,"In northern Gaza, Israel intensified deadly offensive and siege as International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants; Israel agreed ceasefire with Hizbollah and awaited potential Iranian counter-strike.","Israel expanded starvation and depopulation campaign in northern Gaza.

In northern Gaza, Israel’s siege, starvation and indiscriminate violence continued, forcibly displacing up to 131,000 Palestinians since early Oct; Israel blocked all aid to northern Gaza, while humanitarian assistance entering rest of strip plummeted to 11-month low. Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 8 Nov warned that famine threshold in northern Gaza may have been crossed. UN official 12 Nov said conditions are “unfit for human survival”, as heavy rains late Nov increased hardship for over 1.6mn Palestinians in makeshift shelters. UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 14 Nov reported Israel’s warfare in Gaza was “consistent with the characteristics of genocide”. Meanwhile, Hamas and other militants continued to battle Israeli forces, killing at least two dozen soldiers in north since Oct. Qatar 9 Nov suspended mediation efforts until parties show “willingness and seriousness” to end war. ICC 21 Nov issued arrest warrants for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas military chief Mohammad Deif for crimes against humanity and war crimes from Oct 2023 until May 2024. Israel mulled annexation of West Bank. Israel continued airstrikes and incursions in West Bank, bringing death toll since 7 Oct to over 760 Palestinians, as settler violence remained at historic highs. Election of former U.S. president Donald Trump buoyed annexation plans: Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich 11 Nov expressed hopes for annexation in 2025. Israel and Hizbollah agreed truce, Iran vowed retaliation. After expanded Israeli bombardment of Lebanon and Hizbollah counter-strikes, parties 26 Nov struck ceasefire (see Lebanon).

In response, military targeted PKK and its Syrian affiliate in northern Iraq and northern Syria, respectively, hitting over 470 targets and “neutralising” 213 PKK members, according to President Erdoğan. PKK attack occurred just as govt appeared to test waters to see if new process to resolve four-decade conflict can be set in motion. Notably, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party and President Erdoğan’s govt ally, in surprise statement 22 Oct said that authorities should give parole to imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan if he announces group’s dissolution; some media reports suggested that govt had facilitated contacts between imprisoned Öcalan and PKK leadership in Iraq, with Öcalan urging group to end its insurgency.

Iran,October 2024,"Tehran launched ballistic missile barrage at Israel in retaliation for setbacks to non-state allies; Israel responded with airstrikes on military targets in Iran, which may prompt additional counter-attacks.","Tehran and Israel traded direct blows. In retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran (31 July), Hizbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (27 Sept) and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abbas Nilforoushan (27 Sept), Iran 1 Oct launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israeli military sites with little forewarning, leading to at least two dozen confirmed hits, including on Israel’s Nevatim and Tel Nof airbases; shrapnel from interception killed civilian. Israeli PM Netanyahu 1 Oct vowed Iran “will pay”, while FM Abbas Araghchi 2 Oct stated retaliatory action was concluded unless Israel were to “invite further retaliation”. Iran’s mission to UN 3 Oct warned any state allowing Israel use of its territory or airspace to attack would be considered “legitimate target”. Israel 26 Oct struck military targets in Iran, reportedly including air defence systems and missile development sites; Iranian authorities asserted Israeli missiles were launched from Iraqi airspace and confirmed four military fatalities, one civilian death and what they maintained was limited damage, while pledging response. Yet given Israel attacked only military targets and exposed vulnerabilities in Iranian defences, it is possible this round of direct exchanges is over. U.S. officials denied involvement in attack, promised to defend Israel and warned of consequences should Iran choose to respond . Tehran’s overtures to West faltered amid regional hostilities. After President Pezeshkian late Sept attended UN General Assembly, meeting range of Western officials and International Atomic Energy Agency chief in bid to lay groundwork for diplomatic engagement, regional escalation in early Oct appeared to derail efforts. Araghchi 14 Oct asserted “we don’t see any grounds” for indirect nuclear negotiations with U.S. “until we can get past the current crisis”. Citing Iran’s missile attack, U.S. 11 Oct imposed sanctions on 16 Iranian entities and 23 vessels, UK 14 Oct also designated seven senior military and intelligence positions, while EU same day blacklisted 14 individuals and entities for involvement in facilitating military assistance to Russia, including Iran Air."

Israeli forces killed over 1,500 Palestinians in Gaza Strip during Oct, bringing official death toll to at least 43,204 as of 31 Oct. In third offensive in northern Gaza in twelve months, Israel starting 1 Oct ordered evacuation of 300,000-400,000 Palestinians in north, halted all food, water, fuel and medical supplies, segmented territory and constructed new east-west corridor, amid heavy clashes with Hamas. Army encircled Jabaliya refugee camp, razing buildings and conducting mass arrests; amid reports of people starving to death, Gaza authorities 23 Oct reported Israel had killed over 1,000 Palestinians in north’s siege, including many women and children, while UN reported over 71,000 displaced by 29 Oct. In Beit Lahia city, Israeli strikes 19 Oct killed 87 Palestinians and 29 Oct killed over 90 sheltering in residential building. UN human rights chief 25 Oct warned of potential Israeli “atrocity crimes”, while UN’s acting under-sec for humanitarian affairs 26 Oct said “entire population of North Gaza is at risk of dying”. Israel appeared to use siege, starvation and violence to ethnically cleanse north and potentially lay groundwork for Israeli settlements – a strategy it could employ across Gaza Strip. In central and southern Gaza, Israeli strike 13 Oct killed 22, including 15 children, in school in Nuseirat camp; Israeli strike on al-Aqsa hospital next day burnt alive four civilians.
